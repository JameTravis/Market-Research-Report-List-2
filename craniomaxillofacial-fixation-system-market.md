<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Craniomaxillofacial Fixation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The craniomaxillofacial fixation system market comprises two types: absorbable and non-absorbable fixations. Absorbable fixations are made of materials like polymers that gradually dissolve over time, becoming absorbed by the body. These fixations are ideal for temporary use and can reduce the need for a second surgical intervention. On the other hand, non-absorbable fixations are made of metals such as titanium or stainless steel, and they remain in the patient's body permanently. They offer long-term stability and are commonly used in cases where the fracture requires extended support.</p></p>
