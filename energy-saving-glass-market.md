<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Energy Saving Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hollow</li><li>Vacuum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Energy-saving glass is available in various market types, including hollow and vacuum glass. Hollow glass, also known as double-glazed windows, consists of two glass panes separated by a space filled with air or insulating gas. This design offers improved insulation, reducing heat transfer and maintaining indoor temperature stability, leading to reduced energy consumption. Vacuum glass, on the other hand, features a hermetically sealed space between two glass panes, creating a vacuum. This design offers even better insulation performance as there is no air or gas inside, minimizing heat transmission and maximizing energy savings.</p></p>
