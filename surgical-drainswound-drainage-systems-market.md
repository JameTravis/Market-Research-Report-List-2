<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical DrainsWound Drainage Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Surgical drains, also known as wound drainage systems, are used after surgery to remove excess fluid, blood, and other substances from the surgical site. Passive drains work through capillary action and gravity, allowing the fluid to naturally drain out. Active drains, on the other hand, use a pump or vacuum to actively remove the fluid. Both types of drains are essential for promoting healing and preventing complications after surgery. The market for surgical drains includes both passive and active drains, providing options for healthcare professionals based on the patient's needs.</p></p>
