<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Iron Ore Pellets Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Heat Exchange</li><li>Indirect Heat Exchange</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Iron Ore Pellets Dryer Market includes two primary types of drying technologies: Direct Heat Exchange and Indirect Heat Exchange. In Direct Heat Exchange, hot air directly contacts the iron ore pellets, evaporating the moisture and removing it from the pellets. This process is efficient and typically used for high-quality pellets. On the other hand, in Indirect Heat Exchange, the hot air does not directly contact the pellets but instead circulates around them, transferring heat to evaporate the moisture. This method is suitable for lower-grade pellets that require a gentler drying process.</p></p>
