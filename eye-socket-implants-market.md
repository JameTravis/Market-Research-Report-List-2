<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eye Socket Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Porous Material Implants</li><li>Non-porous Material Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The eye socket implants market is categorized into two types: porous material implants and non-porous material implants. Porous material implants are made of materials that have small holes or openings, allowing tissue to grow into them for better integration and stability. This type of implant promotes long-term success and reduces the risk of infections. On the other hand, non-porous material implants do not have these small openings, making them less prone to tissue integration. However, they may provide immediate structural support and stability.</p></p>
