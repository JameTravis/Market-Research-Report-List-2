<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biological Nematicides Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fumigant</li><li>Organic Phosphate</li><li>Carbamate</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The biological nematicides market types can be classified into four categories: fumigant, organic phosphate, carbamate, and others. Fumigant nematicides are gaseous compounds that kill nematodes present in the soil. Organic phosphate nematicides contain organic compounds that disrupt the nervous system of nematodes, leading to their elimination. Carbamate nematicides inhibit the activity of enzymes in nematodes, resulting in their death. Lastly, the category of "other" includes various types of biological nematicides that act through different mechanisms to control nematode populations in agriculture and horticulture.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Biological Nematicides Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fumigation</li><li>Soil Dressing</li><li>Drenching</li><li>Seed Treatment</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Biological nematicides are used in various applications within the market. Fumigation involves the release of gaseous nematicides into the soil to control nematodes. Soil dressing refers to the application of nematicides on the soil surface, allowing them to gradually infiltrate the soil and provide protection against nematodes. Drenching involves the direct application of liquid nematicides to the soil around plant roots. Lastly, seed treatment refers to the coating of seeds with nematicides to protect young plants from nematode infestation. These applications offer effective and sustainable solutions for nematode control in agriculture.</p></p>
