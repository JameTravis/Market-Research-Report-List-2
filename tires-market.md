<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tires</li><li>Bias Tires</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The tire market consists of two main types: radial tires and bias tires. Radial tires are constructed with radial plies that run perpendicularly from the bead to the tread. This design results in a flexible and durable tire that provides better traction and fuel efficiency. Bias tires, on the other hand, are made with multiple layers of fabric that crisscross at angles. They offer a stiffer ride and are commonly used for heavy-duty applications. Understanding the differences between these tire types is crucial for selecting the appropriate tire for specific vehicles and purposes.</p></p>
