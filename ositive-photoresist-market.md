<p><strong>The Ositive Photoresist Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lift-Off</li><li>Array Photo Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The positive photoresist market finds application in two key areas: lift-off and array photo process. In the lift-off process, positive photoresists are used to create patterned structures by depositing a photoresist layer on a substrate, exposing it to ultraviolet light through a mask, and then developing the exposed areas. The unexposed areas are subsequently removed during lift-off, leaving behind the desired pattern. On the other hand, in the array photo process, positive photoresists are utilized to create arrays of patterned structures typically used in microelectronics, display devices, and sensors.</p></p>
