<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Home Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Home boilers are heating systems that provide hot water or steam to homes. There are two main types of home boilers in the market. Non-condensing boilers are traditional systems that utilize the heat produced during combustion and release the waste gases into the atmosphere. On the other hand, condensing boilers are more energy-efficient as they recover and reuse the waste gases by condensing them into water, allowing for better heat extraction. These differences in operation have an impact on the efficiency and environmental impact of the boilers.</p></p>
