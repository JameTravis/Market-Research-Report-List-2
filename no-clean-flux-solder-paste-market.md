<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The No-clean Flux Solder Paste Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Leaded Solder Paste</li><li>Lead-free Solder Paste</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The no-clean flux solder paste market consists of two main types: leaded solder paste and lead-free solder paste. Leaded solder paste contains a small percentage of lead, which enhances solderability and reduces the risk of defects like solder bridges. However, lead is a toxic substance and its use is restricted in some industries. Lead-free solder paste, on the other hand, does not contain any lead and complies with environmental regulations. It offers a safer alternative while still providing good solderability and reliability for various electronic applications.</p></p>
