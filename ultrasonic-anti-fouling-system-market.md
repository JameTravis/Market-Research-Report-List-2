<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Anti-fouling System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Water Transducer</li><li>Contact Transducer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Ultrasonic Anti-fouling System market comprises two types of transducers: Open Water Transducer and Contact Transducer. Open Water Transducers emit ultrasonic waves into the water, creating a high-frequency sound field that repels marine organisms and prevents fouling. Contact Transducers, on the other hand, are directly mounted on the surface that needs protection and use ultrasonic vibrations to repel fouling organisms. Both types of transducers offer effective anti-fouling solutions for various applications, such as boats, offshore structures, and underwater equipment in a non-harmful manner.</p></p>
