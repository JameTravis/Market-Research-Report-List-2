<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrical Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogenated</li><li>Non-halogen</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The electrical plastic market can be classified into two types: halogenated and non-halogenated. Halogenated electrical plastics contain halogens, such as chlorine or bromine, which make them more flame retardant and provide enhanced safety features. On the other hand, non-halogenated electrical plastics do not contain halogens and are considered environmentally friendly. Non-halogenated plastics may be preferred in certain applications where flame retardancy is not a critical requirement or in order to comply with regulations that aim to reduce the use of halogens due to their potential environmental impact.</p></p>
