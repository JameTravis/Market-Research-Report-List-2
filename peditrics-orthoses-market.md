<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peditrics Orthoses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pediatric orthoses are devices designed for children with orthopedic conditions to provide support, stabilization, and correction of musculoskeletal deformities. Active helmets are a type of orthosis that utilizes adjustable components, such as straps and pads, to actively correct and reshape a child's skull shape. These helmets are custom-made for each child and are typically worn continuously for several months. On the other hand, passive helmets are orthoses that mainly provide protective support and prevent external trauma without actively correcting skull deformities. These helmets are often used after surgery or as a preventive measure.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Peditrics Orthoses Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plagiocephaly</li><li>Brachycephaly</li><li>Scaphocephaly</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pediatric orthoses are medical devices designed for children to correct or prevent certain conditions related to the shape and positioning of the head. Plagiocephaly refers to the flattening of one side of the head, brachycephaly involves a wide and short head shape, while scaphocephaly is characterized by an elongated and narrow head. These conditions often occur in infants due to external forces, and pediatric orthoses help in correcting the head shape by providing gentle pressure and support to the skull bones, helping the child's head to grow properly in shape.</p></p>
