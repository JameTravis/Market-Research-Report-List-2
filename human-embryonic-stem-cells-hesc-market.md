<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Human Embryonic Stem Cells (HESC) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Totipotent Stem Cells</li><li>Pluripotent Stem Cells</li><li>Unipotent Stem Cells</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Human embryonic stem cells (HESC) market consists of three types: totipotent stem cells, pluripotent stem cells, and unipotent stem cells. Totipotent stem cells, found in early embryos, have the ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body. Pluripotent stem cells, derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, can give rise to any cell type except the placenta. Unipotent stem cells, found in adult tissues, have a limited ability to differentiate into only one type of cell. These different types of stem cells hold immense potential for regenerative medicine and therapeutic applications.</p></p>
