<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Embolic Protection Devices for Carotid Artery Stenting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distal Occlusion Devices</li><li>Proximal Occlusion Devices</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Embolic protection devices are used during carotid artery stenting procedures to prevent the release of debris and blood clots that can potentially cause stroke. Two types of these devices are available in the market. Distal occlusion devices temporarily block the blood flow distal to the treatment site, capturing embolic material. Proximal occlusion devices, on the other hand, temporarily block the blood flow proximal to the treatment site, capturing embolic materials as well. Both devices aim to minimize the risk of strokes by capturing and removing debris during the procedure.</p></p>
