<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endotracheal Suctioning Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed System</li><li>Open System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Endotracheal suctioning devices are used to remove secretions, mucus, or other substances from the airways of patients with breathing difficulties. Closed system suctioning devices utilize a closed circuit with a catheter and suction canister, minimizing the risk of contamination and maintaining airtightness. Open system suctioning devices, on the other hand, involve an open circuit with a catheter connected directly to the suction source. While closed systems offer better infection control, open systems allow more control during suctioning. Both types cater to different clinical needs and preferences in the market.</p></p>
