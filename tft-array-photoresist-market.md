<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TFT Array Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>TFT Positive Photoresist</li><li>TFT Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The TFT Array Photoresist market comprises two main types: TFT Positive Photoresist and TFT Negative Photoresist. TFT Positive Photoresist is a type of photoresist that becomes more soluble upon exposure to light. This means that after exposure and development, the areas exposed to light are removed, leaving behind the desired pattern for thin-film transistors (TFTs). On the other hand, TFT Negative Photoresist becomes less soluble upon light exposure. After development, the areas not exposed to light are removed, leaving behind the required pattern. Both types play a crucial role in the production of TFT arrays.</p></p>
