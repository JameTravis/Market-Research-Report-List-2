<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Migraine Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Triptans</li><li>Ergots</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Anti-Migraine Drugs market can be categorized into three types: Triptans, Ergots, and Others. Triptans are a commonly prescribed class of drugs that work by constricting blood vessels in the brain, reducing inflammation and relieving migraine symptoms. Ergots, on the other hand, are a less frequently used class of medications that also constrict blood vessels. However, they have more side effects and are typically used as a second-line treatment. Finally, the category of "Others" includes alternative medications and therapies that are sometimes used in combination with Triptans or Ergots for migraine relief.</p></p>
