<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tire Release Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tire Release Agents with Silica Gel</li><li>Tire Release Agents without Silica Gel</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Tire Release Agents market can be categorized into two types: Tire Release Agents with Silica Gel and Tire Release Agents without Silica Gel. Tire Release Agents with Silica Gel are formulated with the inclusion of silica gel, which enhances its effectiveness in preventing rubber from sticking to the mold during tire production. On the other hand, Tire Release Agents without Silica Gel do not contain silica gel but still serve the purpose of separating the tire from the mold. Both types of release agents aid in maintaining manufacturing efficiency and tire quality.</p></p>
