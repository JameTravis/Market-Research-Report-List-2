<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laminating Pouch Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat Sealed Film</li><li>Cold Pouch Film</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Laminating pouch films are used to protect important documents or images by creating a seal around them. Heat-sealed film is a type of laminating pouch film that requires high temperatures to create a strong bond between the pouch and the document. On the other hand, cold pouch film utilizes an adhesive on the inside of the pouch which activates when pressure is applied, eliminating the need for heat. Both types serve the same purpose of safeguarding documents, but differ in the method of application.</p></p>
