<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airboat Propellers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Drive</li><li>Reduction Gear</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Airboat Propellers market can be categorized into two types: Direct Drive and Reduction Gear. Direct Drive refers to a propulsion system where the engine is connected directly to the propeller, without any intermediary components. On the other hand, Reduction Gear is a type of propulsion system where the engine is connected to the propeller through a gearbox, which reduces the rotational speed of the engine and increases the torque. These two market types signify different mechanisms of transferring power from the engine to the propeller in airboat applications.</p></p>
