<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ship Exhaust Gas Cleaning System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Closed Loop Scrubbers</li><li>Hybrid Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ship exhaust gas cleaning system market is comprised of three main types: open loop scrubbers, closed loop scrubbers, and hybrid scrubbers. Open loop scrubbers utilize seawater to remove the pollutants from the ship's exhaust gases before being discharged into the ocean. Closed loop scrubbers, on the other hand, use a liquid to capture the emissions, which is then treated and disposed of onshore. Hybrid scrubbers combine both open and closed loop systems to provide more flexibility in varying environmental conditions.</p></p>
