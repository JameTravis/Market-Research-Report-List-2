<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Monitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intracranial Pressure (ICP) monitors are used to measure the pressure inside the skull. There are two types of ICP monitors: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive monitors involve the insertion of a probe into the brain tissue or a ventricle, providing direct and accurate measurement of ICP. On the other hand, non-invasive monitors measure ICP indirectly through external means, such as ultrasound or transcranial Doppler. While invasive monitors are more precise, they carry higher risks and require surgical placement, while non-invasive monitors are safer and easier to use, but their measurements may be less precise.</p></p>
